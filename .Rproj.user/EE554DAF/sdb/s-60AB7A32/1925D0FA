The task of finding vertex correspondences is similar to  detecting matched pairs\\ref{chap:match_detection} in that both of the tasks require the quantification of a distance between vertex pairs in different graphs. A joint commensurate representation of the vertices of the two graphs  can be used to compute these distances between vertex pairs.\n",
