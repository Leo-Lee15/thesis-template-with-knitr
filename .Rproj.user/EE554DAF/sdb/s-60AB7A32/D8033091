In general, MDS with raw stress will not result in a perfect reconstruction  of the original observations.\n Note that this point is not relevant to our work, as  the objective of the (joint) embedding is not \\emph{perfect} reconstruction, but rather the best embedding for the inference task. What is considered a ``good''  representation will be dependent on how well the original dissimilarities that are relevant to the inference task are preserved. ``Fidelity'' and ``Commensurability'' quantify this preservation of information.\n",
